# HTML-CSS-Basic-FrontEnd-Demos

This repository is a collection of 3 simple demonstrations that I worked on during my coursework to gain experience
with HTML and CSS.

First Demo displays a basic concept of how to interjoin webpage links and also visual marks the change for the user.

The Second Demo displays to concepts specific to adding css styling to HTML in order to create two very different effects.
The first effect shows change to icons based on a hover effect.
The second shows change based on animation when your mouse comes in contact with the icons.

The Third Demo is a combination of CSS and HTML that shows a ficticious webpage designed with html concepts, images, and 
how to create effects and styling using CSS.
